# Comic-Book-Gallery
## Description
This is a simple comic book gallery website that I created as part of a course on [MVC Basics at TeamTreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/aspnet-mvc-basics). The home page of the site displays a list of comic books, which the user can then click on to view more detailed information. The back end of the site is written in C# and the front end uses Bootstrap.

This project was my first introduction to MVC and my goal was to learn the fundamentals of the framework. While creating the site I learned how MVC performs URL routing and how a model, view, and controller all work together to produce a response to a user’s request. I also became more comfortable with Visual Studio’s built in debugger.

The tutorial for this project was originally made for ASP.NET MVC, but I created my project as a .NET CORE MVC app. This allowed me to see the differences between the two and also focus my learning on the newer framework.

This project uses a repository class for the comic book data rather than persisting the data to a database or xml file.

## How to Run
To run this project clone the repository to your local machine and open the .sln file in visual studio. Then run the application using the F5 key.

## Improvements and Additional Features
Additional features that would improve this project include:
- Allowing users to add additional comic books
- Saving those changes to a database
- A search feature
